VID230226:  Software Engineering Fundamentals

This course aims to provide the students with a strong foundation in the fundamental 
principles and practices of software engineering that will prepare them for the advanced
software engineering workshops. As such, a broad range of key software engineering topics will
be taught and reinforced through a group project, that will enable students to apply the 
theoretical concepts acquired to solve a practical software engineering problem. 
An agile software delivery style has been chosen for the implementation of the group project,
to make students familiar with modern agile development methodologies.

## This is an experimental course to introduce students early into software engineering principles.
